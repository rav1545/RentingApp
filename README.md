# RentO

A project for our Senior Design Project at CSUN, 
<br>school year of Fall 2022/ Spring 2023.

Our project is based on the idea of having a e-commerce where people 
are able to rent items or lease their items without going to places like Rent-A-Center or Craigslist.

Project is managed by The Underbots: 
<br>Cristian, 
<br>Vince, 
<br>Mohammed, 
<br>Ravindu,
